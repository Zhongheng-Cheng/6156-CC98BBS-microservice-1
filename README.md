### Folders and files

- `data`: json files containing data

- `resources`: supportive python scripts

- `static`: html files

- `tts`: test cases

- `main.py` is the python application launched to start the web service. 

- The `.gitignore` file is the default for python from GitHub and prevents pushing the virtual environment and python-related files into the repo.

### Python Virtual Environment
